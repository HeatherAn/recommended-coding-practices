# Naming Conventions

Names can really make a difference when it comes to how you future-self and that of others will be able to understand and reuse the code.  

- Use **shorter** names for **short-lived variables** such as index or loop variables. For example: use `i` for the variable that iterates over a **for** loop.  

- Use **descriptive** names for **long-lived variables** (functions, methods, etc.). For example: use `rectangle` for a function that defines the coordinates of a rectangle, instead of calling it `r` or `rect`  

More specific rules on naming objects depend on which object we are talking about. The following rules are based on Python and C/C++ conventions, but you can apply them for different programming languages. If you work in a quite different language, use the following rules as a reference to what to search for when looking for a convention.
    
- Use short names with capitalized words and underscores (`_`) for naming variables and exceptions. For example: `Temp_C` for a variable representing Celsius temperature.
    
- Use lowercase words and underscores for naming functions, modules and methods. Try using verbs. For example: `convert_values`, `evaluate_residuals.py`  
    
- Use capitalized words without underscores for naming classes. For example: `Charge`, `MaterialRecord`  
    
- Use capital letters with underscores for naming constants. For example: `N_MAX`, `HOURS_PER_RUN`

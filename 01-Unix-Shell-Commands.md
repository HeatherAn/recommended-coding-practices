# Unix Shell Commands

The **Unix Shell** is a **command-line interface (CLI)** and a **scripting language**.  

It allows you to **automatize** processes and **access** the files and directories of your computer in an effective way. Much more effective than using the computer systemâ€™s graphical user interface (see Figure below).  

The most popular Unix Shell is **Bash**: the **Bourne Again SHell**. But there are many more! In this repository we will only focus on **Bash**.

# Keep It Simple

Spend some time thinking about the design of the code you will be developing to solve the problem in question. 

- Try to keep it simple! Keep in mind *simple* does not mean *easy*. *Simple* refers to **doing one step/task at a time**.

- **Segment** the code as much as possible into smaller and simpler pieces of code. Create functions whenever your code is doing several things, or whenever you have too many levels of indentation. This will allow you to modify the different functions separately and tune things more easily when necessary. 

- Think how to group functions and methods into separate scripts (libraries or packages). Can a class be defined? What parts of the code can work independently from one another? Do you really need to keep everything in a single script? etc. **Grouping** will allow you to modify things more easily, and reuse the code for other purposes than for what it was originally developed.

- Avoid nesting functions! **Nesting** functions refers to writing functions inside functions. The more you nest functions, the more difficult and tricky it becomes to modify them and built upon them.

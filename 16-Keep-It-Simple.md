# Keep It Simple

Spend some time thinking about the design of the code you will be developing to solve the problem in question. 

- Try to keep it simple! Keep in mind *simple* does not mean *easy*. *Simple* refers more to **doing one step/task at a time**.  

- **Segment** the code as much as possible into smaller and simpler pieces of code (e.g. create a more modular structure whenever you have too many levels of indentation). This will allow you to modify the different segments separately and tune things more easily when necessary.  

- Think how to **group** functions and methods into separate scripts (libraries or packages). Can a class be defined? What parts of the code can work independently from one another? Do you really need to keep everything in a single script? etc. **Grouping** will allow you to modify things more easily, and re-use the code for purposes other than for what it was originally developed.  

- **Avoid nesting** functions! Nesting functions refers to writing functions inside functions. The more you nest functions, the more difficult and tricky it becomes to modify them and built upon them.

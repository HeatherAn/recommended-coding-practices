# Recommended Coding Practices

We are not professional coders, but we all must code to **survive!** 

In this **Recommended Coding Practices** repository you will find introductory and broad material to start developing **proper code** and promote further **self-study**. 

The material was originally designed for researchers within the [Aerospace Structures and Materials department](https://www.tudelft.nl/lr/organisatie/afdelingen/aerospace-structures-and-materials) of the [Faculty of Aerospace Engineering (AE)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ae) of the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in The Netherlands. 

Practice and enjoy!

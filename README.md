If you are already familiar with some of the material, you can go directly to the **cheatsheets** and the **templates** 🧠🔖:  
- [Bash Cheatsheet](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/blob/main/05-Bash-Cheatsheet.md)  
- [Git Cheatsheet](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/blob/main/13-Git-Cheatsheet.md)  
- [README templates](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/tree/main/templates) for data, code and machine-learning projects.  
    * The README for a data repository (`README_data.txt`) is in `.txt` format. Fill it in according to what is asked in commented text (in between `<!---` and `-->`). Then rename the file as `README.txt` and put it at the top-level of the `data/` directory.      
    * The README for a code repository (`README_code.md`) and machine-learning projects (`README_ML.md`) are written in Markdown. Use the `Code` tab instead of the `Preview` tab to see the commented text. Fill in the template according to what is asked in commented text (in between `<!---` and `-->`). Then rename the file as `README.md` and keep it at the top-level of the project repository.    


## How to follow the material? 🧠

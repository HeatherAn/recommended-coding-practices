- [README templates](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/tree/main/templates) for data, code and machine-learning projects.  
    * The README for data (`README_data.txt`) is in txt format. Fill it in according to what is asked in commented text (in between `<!---` and `-->`). Then rename the file to README.txt.   
    * The README for code (`README_code.md`) and machine-learning projects (`README_ML.md`) are written in Markdown. Use the `Code` tab instead of the `Preview` tab to see the commented text. Fill in the template according to what is asked in commented text (in between `<!---` and `-->`). Then rename the file to README.md.

## Contents

In this repository you will find the following material:
- [Unix Shell Bash commands](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/blob/main/01-Unix-Shell-Commands.md)  
- [Environment variables](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/blob/main/03-Environment-Variables.md)  
- [Aliases](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/blob/main/04-Aliases.md) 
- [Version control with Git](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/blob/main/06-Version-Control-With-Git.md)  
- [Project structure recommendations](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/blob/main/14-Project-Structure.md)
- [Coding conventions](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/blob/main/15-Coding-Conventions.md)  
- [Naming conventions](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/blob/main/18-Naming-Conventions.md)  
- [Code documentation](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/blob/main/20-Code-Documentation.md)
- Guidelines on what to do once you [finish a project](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/blob/main/22-Publish-Or-Archive.md)  

If you are already familiar with some of the material, you can go directly to the **cheatsheets** and the **templates**:  
- [Bash Cheatsheet](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/blob/main/05-Bash-Cheatsheet.md)  
- [Git Cheatsheet](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/blob/main/13-Git-Cheatsheet.md)  
- [README templates](https://github.com/HeatherAn/recommended-coding-practices/tree/main/templates) for data, code and machine-learning projects.  
    * The README for a data repository (`README_data.txt`) is in `.txt` format. Fill it in according to what is asked in commented text (in between `<!---` and `-->`). Then rename the file as `README.txt` and put it at the top-level of the `data/` directory.      
    * The README for a code repository (`README_code.md`) and machine-learning projects (`README_ML.md`) are written in Markdown. Use the `Code` tab instead of the `Preview` tab to see the commented text. Fill in the template according to what is asked in commented text (in between `<!---` and `-->`). Then rename the file as `README.md` and keep it at the top-level of the project repository.    


## How to follow the material?

The material is presented in separate **Markdown** files. In order to go through the material, **follow the numerical order** of the names of the files. At the end of each page you will also find the **Previous** and **Next** links that will take you through the material in sequential order.
